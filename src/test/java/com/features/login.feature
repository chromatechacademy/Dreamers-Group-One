Feature: MOBILE - Login with valid credentials

@DG1-21
Scenario: As a Chroma Tech faculty member, I want to be able to login to the Chroma Tech Academy School management system via a mobile device 



Given Chroma Tech Academy teacher/admin user is logged in to the CTSMS Dashboard 
When a Chroma Tech faculty member logs in with valid credentials via a mobile device 
Then Chroma Tech faculty member has no issues and is successfully logged in to Chroma Tech Academy School management system
